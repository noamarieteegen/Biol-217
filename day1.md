 ## 1. Pattern Syntax
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions (EREs,
              see below).

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular
              expressions.

       -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret PATTERNS as basic regular expressions (BREs, see
              below).  This is the default.

       -P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret PATTERNS as Perl-compatible regular expressions
              (PCREs).  This option is experimental when combined with
              the -z (--null-data) option, and grep -P may warn of
              unimplemented features.

   ## 2. Matching Control
       -e PATTERNS, --regexp=PATTERNS
              Use PATTERNS as the patterns.  If this option is used
              multiple times or is combined with the -f (--file) option,
              search for all patterns given.  This option can be used to
              protect a pattern beginning with “-”.

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is
              used multiple times or is combined with the -e (--regexp)
              option, search for all patterns given.  The empty file
              contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.  If
              FILE is - , read patterns from standard input.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so
              that characters that differ only in case match each other.

       --no-ignore-case
              Do not ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data.
              This is the default.  This option is useful for passing to
              shell scripts that already use -i, to cancel its effects
              because the two options override each other.

       -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

       -w, --word-regexp
              Select only those lines containing matches that form whole
              words.  The test is that the matching substring must either
              be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word
              constituent character.  Similarly, it must be either at the
              end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent
              character.  Word-constituent characters are letters,
              digits, and the underscore.  This option has no effect if
              -x is also specified.

       -x, --line-regexp
              Select only those matches that exactly match the whole
              line.  For a regular expression pattern, this is like
              parenthesizing the pattern and then surrounding it with ^
              and $.

   ## 3. General Output Control
       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching
              lines for each input file.  With the -v, --invert-match
              option (see above), count non-matching lines.

       --color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
              Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, matching lines,
              context lines, file names, line numbers, byte offsets, and
              separators (for fields and groups of context lines) with
              escape sequences to display them in color on the terminal.
              The colors are defined by the environment variable
              GREP_COLORS.  WHEN is never, always, or auto.

       -L, --files-without-match
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each
              input file from which no output would normally have been
              printed.

       -l, --files-with-matches
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each
              input file from which output would normally have been
              printed.  Scanning each input file stops upon first match.

       -m NUM, --max-count=NUM
              Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If NUM is
              zero, grep stops right away without reading input.  A NUM
              of -1 is treated as infinity and grep does not stop; this
              is the default.  If the input is standard input from a
              regular file, and NUM matching lines are output, grep
              ensures that the standard input is positioned to just after
              the last matching line before exiting, regardless of the
              presence of trailing context lines.  This enables a calling
              process to resume a search.  When grep stops after NUM
              matching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.
              When the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not
              output a count greater than NUM.  When the -v or
              --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after
              outputting NUM non-matching lines.

       -o, --only-matching
              Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching
              line, with each such part on a separate output line.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.  Exit
              immediately with zero status if any match is found, even if
              an error was detected.  Also see the -s or --no-messages
              option.

       -s, --no-messages
              Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable
              files.

   ## 4. Output Line Prefix Control
       -b, --byte-offset
              Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before
              each line of output.  If -o (--only-matching) is specified,
              print the offset of the matching part itself.

       -H, --with-filename
              Print the file name for each match.  This is the default
              when there is more than one file to search.  This is a GNU
              extension.

       -h, --no-filename
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is
              the default when there is only one file (or only standard
              input) to search.

       --label=LABEL
              Display input actually coming from standard input as input
              coming from file LABEL.  This can be useful for commands
              that transform a file's contents before searching, e.g.,
              gzip -cd foo.gz | grep --label=foo -H 'some pattern'.  See
              also the -H option.

       -n, --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number
              within its input file.

       -T, --initial-tab
              Make sure that the first character of actual line content
              lies on a tab stop, so that the alignment of tabs looks
              normal.  This is useful with options that prefix their
              output to the actual content: -H,-n, and -b.  In order to
              improve the probability that lines from a single file will
              all start at the same column, this also causes the line
              number and byte offset (if present) to be printed in a
              minimum size field width.

       -Z, --null
              Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the
              character that normally follows a file name.  For example,
              grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file name instead
              of the usual newline.  This option makes the output
              unambiguous, even in the presence of file names containing
              unusual characters like newlines.  This option can be used
              with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and
              xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those that
              contain newline characters.

   ## 5. Context Line Control
       -A NUM, --after-context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.
              Places a line containing a group separator (--) between
              contiguous groups of matches.  With the -o or
              --only-matching option, this has no effect and a warning is
              given.

       -B NUM, --before-context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.
              Places a line containing a group separator (--) between
              contiguous groups of matches.  With the -o or
              --only-matching option, this has no effect and a warning is
              given.

       -C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of output context.  Places a line
              containing a group separator (--) between contiguous groups
              of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching option, this
              has no effect and a warning is given.

       --group-separator=SEP
              When -A, -B, or -C are in use, print SEP instead of --
              between groups of lines.

       --no-group-separator
              When -A, -B, or -C are in use, do not print a separator
              between groups of lines.

   ## 6. File and Directory Selection
       -a, --text
              Process a binary file as if it were text; this is
              equivalent to the --binary-files=text option.
